Idea Flow:
1. Filter out actual Operative values and Animal text placeholders.
2. Isolate Unique Operative values.
3. Find Unique Operative values in the Animal text placeholder data Article title column and add found Operative in a new column.
4. Rename this new operative match column as Operative.
5. Union 309 actual Operative values records with 93 Animal text placeholders (now matched as operatives) records.
6. Group by Operative and Count Article Titles alias as Incident Count.
7. Sort Incident Count descending.
